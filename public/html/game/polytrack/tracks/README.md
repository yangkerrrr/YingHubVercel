When adding new .track files to the community or official folders on GitHub Pages, remember to update the JavaScript bundle (specifically the fallback track arrays) and redeploy, because GitHub Pages does not expose directory listings and the game cannot auto-discover new files at runtime. Run `npm run update-fallbacks` before deploying so the bundle picks up the new filenames automatically.
